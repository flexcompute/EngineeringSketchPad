               Welcome to MSC Nastran 2021.3
  
  
   MSC Nastran brings powerful new features and enhancements for engineering
   solutions.
  
     MSC Nastran 2021.3 Features and Enhancements
  
     Dynamics
      - Dynamic stiffness output for mechanical loading in direct and modal
        frequency response (SOL 108 and SOL 111), design optimization
        (SOL 200 analysis) and implicit nonlinear (SOL 400 linear)
  
     Results
      - Relative displacement output for a grid, or set of grids with respect
        to reference grid for linear statics, dynamics and nonlinear analysis
  
     RotorDynamics
      - Output of rotordynamics rotor kinetic and potential energies to OP2, PCH
        and H5 formats, via a new ROTSEKE Case Control entry, and which can be
        sorted either rotor-wise of mode-wise (replaces previous ROTSEKE
        parameter which is now deprecated)
      - New capability to define spin speed for individual rotors available in
        SOL 107, SOL 110, SOL 200 and SOL 400 (ANALYSIS = CEIG) â€“ multiple RGYR
        entries are allowed for individual rotors
  
     Fatigue
      - Time domain performance improvements
      - CAEfatigue Process Flow interface to facilitate analysis and results
        postprocessing execution
  
     Nonlinear
      - Enhanced contact projection algorithm at corners and on warped surfaces
      - GLUEOUT option to separate normal and tangential glued contact force
        output
  
     High Performance Computing
      - SOL 400 element-loop (NLEMG) performance improvements
      - Windows support for MUMPS solver in SOL 101
      - Improved thread management for DMP/SMP combinations
      - Support for CUDA 11 functionality (including NVIDIA Ampere GPU
        architecture)
