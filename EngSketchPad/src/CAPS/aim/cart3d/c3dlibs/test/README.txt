C3DIO TESTER
------------

To test reading and writing surface triangulations, make sure that the
test_c3dio executable is compiled and installed in '../bin'. See '../
README.txt' for instructions.

To read and write triangulation files in the traditional Cart3D
format:

  ../bin/test_c3dio cube.tri test.tri

To read and write extended triangulation files (VTK/VTU):

  ../bin/test_c3dio cube_vtk.tri test_vtk.tri

In both cases, the generated output should be the same as the input, i.e.,

  diff cube.tri test.tri
  diff cube_vtk.tri test_vtk.tri

should not find any differences.  The sample test code
../c3dio/test_c3dio.c demonstrates basic usage of the libc3dio.a library. 


XDDM TESTER
-----------

To test reading and writing XDDM files, make sure that the test_xddm
executable is compiled and installed in '../bin/test_xddm'. See '../
README.txt' for instructions.

To parse the content of an XDDM file for given XPath expression, use

  ../bin/test_xddm basic.xml /Model

The test generates xtest_echo.xml that should be identical to
basic.xml:

  diff basic.xml xtest_echo.xml

The test also writes xtest_opt.xml that echoes a node created in
../xddm/main.c.  The XDDM specification is provided in '../doc'.
