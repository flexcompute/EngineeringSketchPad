/**
 * Example client of libxddm. For XDDM documentation, see
 * $CART3D/doc/xddm/xddm.html. The library uses XML Path Language
 * (XPath) to search XDDM documents. For XPath
 * tutorials, see the web, for example:
 * https://www.developer.com/microsoft/dotnet/net-and-xml-xpath-queries/
 *
 * Usage: test_xddm <xddm_filename> <xpath_expression>
 *
 * Dependency: libxml2
 * https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/wikis/homewww.xmlsoft.org
 * This library is usually present on most systems, check via
 * existence of 'xml2-config' script.
