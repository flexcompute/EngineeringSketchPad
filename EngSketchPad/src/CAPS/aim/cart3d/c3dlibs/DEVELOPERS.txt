The initial C3DIO functions were developed by Michael Aftosmis and
Marsha Berger in 1998. The library is being maintained and improved by
Cart3D developers at NASA Ames, including Michael Aftosmis, Marsha
Berger, Marian Nemec, Dave Rodriguez, Jon Chiew and Wade Spurlock, and
includes contributions from Scott Murman, Shishir Pandya, George
Anderson and Alex Kleb.  The VTK format extension and XDDM library
