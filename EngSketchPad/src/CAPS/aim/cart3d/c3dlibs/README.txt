Support Libraries for Cart3D I/O Functions and Extensible Design
Description Markup
================================================================

Read COPYRIGHT.txt (NOSA.pdf, INDIVIDUAL-CLA.pdf and
CORPORATE-CLA.pdf) files for legal and license terms.


DESCRIPTION

This is a collection of functions used for various I/O functions of
the Cart3D aerodynamic analysis and optimization package. This
includes reading and writing surface triangulation files, volume mesh
files and files for aerodynamic shape optimization
problems. Description of the classic TRI file format is available
here:
https://www.nas.nasa.gov/publications/software/docs/cart3d/pages/cart3dTriangulations.html#1.%20Component%20file%20forma
Description of the newer VTK/VTU file format is available here:
https://kitware.github.io/vtk-examples/site/VTKFileFormats/#xml-file-formats
All triangulation and grid IO functions are in the 'c3dio'
directory. The XDDM library is in the 'xddm' directory.  It implements
the Extensible Design Description Markup specification, which is
provided in the 'doc' directory.


REQUIREMENTS

  1) Linux, macOS or Windows
  2) C compiler, e.g., gcc
  3) libxml2 (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/wikis/home)
  4) For Windows: tested with Cygwin. Requires make, libiconv, zlib, liblzma

  To check availability of libxml2, use:
  
    xml2-config --help


INSTALL

  To build IO libraries for reading Cart3D triangulations and grids:

    cd c3dio
    make

  This should build the libc3dio.a library. To test the library:

    make test

  This should build the test_c3dio executable. To install the library,
  tester and headers:

   make install

  The default install location is the current directory: ./lib, ./bin
  and ./include.

  Additional make commands:

    make clean
    make distclean

  To build XDDM:

    cd xddm
    make
    make test
    make install


TEST and EXAMPLES

  Read test/README.txt file.
